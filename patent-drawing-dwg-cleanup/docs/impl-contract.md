# v2 implementation contract

**Read this file completely before writing any code.** It is the single source of truth for module
boundaries, function signatures, JSON shapes, and determinism rules. Where this file and any other
document disagree, this file wins. If something you need is genuinely unspecified here, pick the
option that is most deterministic and record it in your report's `open_issues` — do not invent a
parallel convention.

Rationale for the whole design is in [iteration-plan-v2.md](iteration-plan-v2.md).

---

## 0. Prime directives

1. **The LLM's only output is `figure-plan.json`.** No layout constants, coordinates, text heights,
   or numerals ever come from a model. Everything geometric is computed by these modules.
2. **Determinism is a correctness property, not a nicety.** Same inputs → byte-identical output
   after normalization. Every algorithm here must be reproducible across machines and runs.
3. **One OCC boundary.** `patent_figure/occ_backend.py` is the *only* module that may
   `import OCP.*`. Every other module operates on plain numpy arrays and dicts, so it is unit
   testable without CAD libraries installed.

## 1. Environment (already verified on the dev machine)

| Package | Version | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cadquery-ocp` | 7.7.2 | OCCT 7.7.2 bindings, namespace `OCP.*`. **pip-installable.** |
| `ezdxf` | 1.4.2 | |
| `numpy` | 2.0.2 | |
| `jsonschema` | 4.25.1 | plan/assembly validation |
| `matplotlib` | 3.9.4 | preview PNG rendering only |
| `pytest` | 8.4.2 | |

Do **not** import `OCC.Core.*` (that is the conda-only `pythonocc-core`). This project uses `OCP.*`.

Also verified on the dev machine, so do not spend agent time rediscovering it:

- `ezdxf.addons.drawing` with the `matplotlib` backend imports cleanly — use it for `render_preview`.
- `simfang.ttf` is **not installed** here (only `Songti.ttc`). `doctor.py` must report this as a
  real finding, not a hard failure: the DXF still records the style name `simfang.ttf`, and the
  consequence is that Chinese text renders with a fallback locally and may box out on a machine
  without the font. The portable-DWG outlined-text route in `references/workflow.md` §4 exists for
  exactly this case.
- AutoCAD 2026 **is** installed at `/Applications/Autodesk/AutoCAD 2026`, and LibreDWG `dwgread`
  **is** on `PATH` at `/opt/homebrew/bin/dwgread`. Both conversion routes are testable here.
Python is 3.9. Verified on this machine: `list[int]` / `dict[str, int]` **do** work at runtime
(PEP 585 landed in 3.9), but `int | str` raises `TypeError`, and `match` does not parse. Add
`from __future__ import annotations` to every module anyway — it makes all annotations lazy, so the
union syntax used throughout this contract's signatures is legal.

## 2. Frozen files — do not modify

`scripts/cad_hlr_to_dxf.py`, `scripts/clean_patent_dxf.py`, `scripts/validate_clean_dxf.py`,
`scripts/autocad_core_dxf_to_dwg.py`, `scripts/libredwg_dxf_to_dwg.py`.

The new package **copies** the OCC logic it needs into `occ_backend.py` (adapted, not imported).
Legacy refactoring is a separate pass. `cad_hlr_to_dxf.py` stays as the single-view legacy route.

## 4. Data shapes

### 4.1 `assembly.json`

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "patent-assembly/1",
  "source": {"step": "<path>", "sha256": "<hex>", "instances": 164, "distinct": 125},
  "units": "mm",
  "bbox": {"lo": [x,y,z], "hi": [x,y,z], "size": [w,d,h]},
  "parts": [{
    "name": "PRT0001",
    "instances": 4,
    "bbox_size": [w,d,h],           // of one instance, rounded to 3 decimals
    "max_dim": 12.5,
    "centers": [[x,y,z], ...],      // one per instance, sorted lexicographically
    "degenerate": false,            // true when max_dim < 1e-6
    "path_sample": "root/sub/PRT0001"
  }],
  "principal_axis": {"vector": [0,0,1], "nearest": "z", "spread_ratio": 4.21},
  "coaxial_groups": [{
    "id": "g1", "axis": [0,0,1], "origin": [x,y,0],
    "members": ["PRT0001", "PRT0002"], "instances": 12,
    "extent": [z_lo, z_hi]
  }],
  "stack_order": ["PRT0007", "PRT0001", ...],   // by projection of center onto principal axis
  "size_tiers": [{"tier": "large", "members": [...]}, {"tier":"medium",...}, {"tier":"small",...}],
  "split_suggestions": [{
    "id": "coaxial", "strategy": "coaxial",
    "figures": [{"caption_hint": "组件 A 分解", "members": ["PRT0001","PRT0002"], "labels": 14}]
  }],
  "warnings": ["3 part(s) have degenerate bounding boxes: PRT0004, PRT0005, ..."]
}
```

When the assembly exceeds the label cap, all three strategies are **attempted** — `coaxial` (by
coaxial group), `stack` (by breaks in `stack_order` spacing), `size` (by `size_tiers`) — and a
strategy is emitted only if every figure it proposes satisfies `labels <= max_labels_per_figure`.
A strategy that cannot reach the cap is reported in `warnings` with the count it got to, never
emitted as a suggestion. If **no** strategy succeeds, `split_suggestions` is `[]` and `warnings`
says so; that is a legitimate outcome, not a bug — the human then has to choose the grouping.

(The earlier wording said three suggestions are "always emitted" *and* that each must satisfy the
cap. Those cannot both hold. Flagged by the cross-model contract audit; see §12.)

### 4.2 `figure-plan.json`

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "patent-figure-plan/1",
  "source": {"step": "<path>", "include": ["glob"], "exclude": ["glob"]},
  "terms": [
    {"selector": "PRT0001", "term": "底座", "label": "once"},
    {"selector": "SCREW*",  "term": "紧固螺钉", "label": "none"}
  ],
  "figures": [
    {"id": "fig1", "caption": "整体结构示意图", "kind": "assembly", "members": ["*"]},
    {"id": "fig2", "caption": "回转组件分解示意图", "kind": "exploded",
     "members": ["PRT0001", "PRT0002"], "layout": {"explode_axis": "z"}}
  ],
  "layout": {                       // defaults; a figure may override any key
    "view": "iso",
    "explode_axis": "auto",
    "axis_angle": "auto",
    "density": "normal",
    "max_labels_per_figure": 20,
    "engineering_table": false
  }
}
```

Rules enforced by `plan.py`:

- `terms[].selector` is an fnmatch glob; **every selector must match ≥1 part** in `assembly.json`.
- `terms[].term` must not match any pattern in `forbidden_term_patterns` (default: internal part-code
  shapes, see §7). Terms are Chinese technical nouns.
- `terms[].label` ∈ `once | all | none`. Default `once`.
  `once` labels **exactly one instance**: the one whose `key` sorts first among that part's
  instances in the figure (`key` is `name#instance_index`, and `instance_index` is assigned after
  the global sort in §5.1, so this is stable). `all` labels every instance; `none` labels none and
  the part still gets a numeral in the global table only if some other figure labels it.
- `terms` order is the numeral issue order. **The plan never contains numerals.**
- `figures[].kind` ∈ `assembly | exploded`.
- `figures[].members` globs resolve against selected parts; a member matching no part is an error.
- Effective label count per figure ≤ `max_labels_per_figure`, else `E_TOO_MANY_LABELS`.
- `layout.view` ∈ the `VIEWS` enum; `explode_axis` ∈ `x|y|z|auto`; `density` ∈ `compact|normal|loose`.
- `layout.axis_angle` is `"auto"` (the default) or a number clamped to `[120, 180]` with `W_CLAMPED`.

  **`"auto"` means the renderer solves the sheet angle itself**, per figure, using the closed form
  in §11.2 (`axis_angle_opt`, the angle at which the geometry aspect ratio matches the usable-area
  aspect ratio and `sheet_fill` is maximised). This is an **architect ruling that supersedes
  §11.10 #7**, which set a fixed default of 124.

  The reason is prime directive #1. The optimal angle depends on the string length to width ratio,
  so it is a property of the figure, not a constant: 124 is optimal for the 20-part stack §11.1.2
  measured, and roughly 111 for the eight-part synthetic fixture — both computed from the same
  closed form. Shipping any fixed number means most assemblies fail the `sheet_fill` gate on the
  first render, and the repair the model is asked to make is to copy a number the script already
  computed into the plan. That is a layout constant travelling through the model, which is exactly
  what this contract exists to prevent. A model may still pin an explicit angle when it wants a
  particular look; it just is not asked to supply one to get a correct drawing.
- **No other keys are accepted.** `additionalProperties: false` everywhere.

### 4.3 `reference-numerals.json`

```jsonc
{"schema": "patent-numerals/1",
 "numerals": [{"numeral": 1, "term": "底座", "selector": "PRT0001", "figures": ["fig1","fig2"]}],
 "description_zh": "附图标记说明：1—底座；2—回转轴组件；……"}
```

### 4.4 `qa.json`

```jsonc
{"schema": "patent-figure-qa/1", "file": "fig1.dxf", "pass": false,
 "checks": [{"id": "geometry_occupancy", "pass": false, "value": 0.135,
             "threshold": ">=0.55", "detail": "...", "hint": "..."}],
 "summary": {"failed": 5, "passed": 4}}
```

## 5. Module signatures

Every module starts with `from __future__ import annotations`.

### 5.1 `occ_backend.py` — the only OCC module

```python
VIEWS: dict[str, tuple[float, float]]        # name -> (az, el); same 7 entries as the legacy script

class ViewFrame:
    def __init__(self, az: float, el: float, roll: float = 0.0) -> None
    x: np.ndarray; u: np.ndarray; w: np.ndarray      # right, up, view direction (unit, right-handed)
    def to2d(self, pts: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray    # (...,3) -> (...,2)
    @property
    def key(self) -> str
        """Exactly f"{az:.4f}_{el:.4f}_{roll:.4f}" — four decimals, no rounding of the stored
        floats themselves. Four is enough that a 1e-4 degree difference busts the cache and not
        enough for float noise to do so."""

def roll_for_axis(axis, az: float, el: float, target_deg: float) -> float
    """Solve in closed form, do NOT search. With e = the axis projected into the unroll ed view
    plane, the sheet angle is atan2(e_u, e_x); the roll that moves it to target is

        roll = target_deg - degrees(atan2(e_u, e_x))

    normalised into [0, 360). The legacy implementation stepped through candidate angles and
    compared raw floats, which violates §7 rule 4; the closed form removes both problems.
    Raise ValueError when |e| < 1e-9 (axis parallel to the view direction)."""

class PartShape:
    key: str          # f"{name}#{instance_index}" — the stable identity used everywhere downstream
    name: str
    path: str
    instance_index: int
    lo: np.ndarray; hi: np.ndarray                   # 3D bbox
    shape: Any                                       # TopoDS_Shape
    @property
    def center(self) -> np.ndarray
    @property
    def degenerate(self) -> bool                     # max extent < 1e-6

def load_assembly(step: Path) -> list[PartShape]
    """Deterministic order. The sort key is exactly:

        (name, path, round(cx, 6), round(cy, 6), round(cz, 6))

    where c is the instance centre in model coordinates and 6 is the decimal count — fixed here so
    two implementers cannot pick different precisions. Ties beyond that key keep the order OCCT
    produced, which is NOT guaranteed stable across OCCT builds; if two instances tie on the full
    key they are geometrically identical at micron resolution, so which one takes which
    instance_index cannot change any output. instance_index is assigned AFTER this sort, so the
    same STEP always yields the same keys."""

def part_curves(part: PartShape, view: ViewFrame, deflection: float) -> list[np.ndarray]
    """Per-part HLR. VALID ONLY for parts that are disjoint on the sheet."""

def scene_curves(parts: Sequence[PartShape], view: ViewFrame, deflection: float,
                 want_hidden: bool = False) -> tuple[list[np.ndarray], list[np.ndarray]]
    """Global HLR over all parts together. REQUIRED for kind='assembly' figures, where parts
    occlude each other. Returns (visible, hidden) as lists of (N,2) float arrays."""

class GeometryCache:
    def __init__(self, root: Path, step_sha: str) -> None
    def get(self, part_key: str, view: ViewFrame, deflection: float) -> list[np.ndarray] | None
    def put(self, part_key: str, view: ViewFrame, deflection: float,
            curves: list[np.ndarray]) -> None
```

**HLR compounds to collect** (copy the legacy behaviour): `VCompound`, `Rg1LineVCompound`,
`OutLineVCompound` for visible; `HCompound`, `Rg1LineHCompound`, `OutLineHCompound` for hidden.
Omitting `OutLine*` breaks dome and fillet silhouettes.

**Cache**: `<root>/<step_sha[:12]>/<view.key>_<deflection>/<sha1(part_key)>.npz`, storing curves as
`arr_0..arr_n`. A cache hit must be bit-identical to a recompute. Load 24 s on the reference
assembly makes this mandatory, not optional.

### 5.2 `layout.py` — pure 2D, no OCC, no ezdxf

```python
# Gap between adjacent parts on the sheet, as a fraction of the MEDIAN part extent along the
# explode direction — not of the total string length. Keying it to the median is what stops the
# v1 failure where a longer string shrank every part's slot while the gap grew.
DENSITY: dict[str, float] = {"compact": 0.35, "normal": 0.55, "loose": 0.85}

@dataclass
class Piece:
    key: str
    name: str
    curves: list[np.ndarray]      # 2D, unplaced (view-projected, model position)
    offset: np.ndarray = field(default_factory=lambda: np.zeros(2))
    @property
    def lo(self) -> np.ndarray    # placed bbox min  (curves min + offset)
    @property
    def hi(self) -> np.ndarray
    def placed(self) -> list[np.ndarray]

@dataclass
class LayoutResult:
    pieces: list[Piece]
    lo: np.ndarray; hi: np.ndarray     # overall geometry bbox after placement
    slot: float                        # min over pieces of max(hi-lo) — drives text height
    rows: int
    diagnostics: dict                  # {"strategy": ..., "gap": ..., "overlaps": 0}

def layout_assembly(pieces: list[Piece]) -> LayoutResult
    """No displacement. Parts keep their projected positions."""

def layout_exploded(pieces: list[Piece], axis2d: np.ndarray, density: str,
                    sheet_aspect: float = 0.75, max_rows: int = 1) -> LayoutResult
    """<<ALGORITHM SPECIFIED IN §11 — implement exactly what is written there.>>

    `max_rows` accepts ONLY 1. Any other value raises LayoutError. §11.1 rules out two-dimensional
    rearrangement: displacing parts off the assembly axis misrepresents the assembly relationship,
    which is the one thing an exploded patent figure exists to convey. It must not silently degrade
    to a single row either — then a caller that passes the argument and one that forgets it would
    render two different figures and both would pass QA."""

FRAME_W, FRAME_H = 180.0, 250.0   # A4 portrait minus a 15 mm margin, in millimetres

def fit_to_frame(result: LayoutResult, frame_w: float = FRAME_W, frame_h: float = FRAME_H,
                 margin: float = 0.0) -> float
    """Return the largest uniform scale factor that still fits:

        usable_w = frame_w * (1 - 2*margin);  usable_h = frame_h * (1 - 2*margin)
        s        = min(usable_w / bbox_w, usable_h / bbox_h)

    There is deliberately NO area-target term. An earlier draft capped s at a TARGET_OCCUPANCY of
    the usable area; §11.1 D1 shows why that was wrong — `geometry_occupancy` is scale-invariant,
    so shrinking the drawing cannot improve it, and the cap only pushed text height down 21% until
    it fell through the 3.5 mm floor. Page filling is measured by the separate `sheet_fill` gate
    (§11.1 D2), which is governed by aspect ratio, not by scale.

    `margin` defaults to 0.0 because FRAME_W/FRAME_H is already the usable area; the label margin
    and caption band are subtracted explicitly by §11.6. Insetting again here double-counts and
    the geometry can never reach the paper edge. Never mutates the pieces."""
```

Hard postcondition of `layout_exploded`: **no two placed BODY bboxes overlap** (a body is a group
of pieces that must stay together — a bolt circle, a set of identical screws; §11.3 S8 defines it,
and members within one body may overlap each other), verified inside the function with a tolerance
of `1e-6 * SCALE_REF` on each axis — a **relative** tolerance, because `layout.py` receives model
units and the same assembly exported in metres versus millimetres would otherwise get a tolerance
that is either inert or over-merging. Touching edges are not an overlap. Raise `LayoutError` if the
invariant cannot be met.

`LayoutResult.slot` is reported on two gauges, because a `label: "none"` washer must not be allowed
to shrink every numeral on the sheet: `slot` is `min(min-over-pieces of max(hi-lo),
SLOT_QA_CAP_K * diagonal / n_labels)`, and `diagnostics["slot_labelled"]` carries the smallest
outline among **labelled** parts only. Text height is solved from `slot_labelled` (§11.6).

All four audit models asked whether that escape hatch is reachable and well defined. It is, and
this is how: the invariant is always satisfiable for `layout_exploded` on its own, because parts
are laid end to end along one direction with a positive gap, so `LayoutError` can only fire on
degenerate input — a piece with zero extent, or a non-finite coordinate. What is **not** always
satisfiable is the combination of zero overlap *and* the occupancy target *and* the label budget;
that tension is resolved by `fit_to_frame` returning a smaller scale and QA reporting the
shortfall, never by the layout silently overlapping parts.

### 5.3 `labels.py` — pure 2D

```python
@dataclass
class LabelRequest:
    key: str
    numeral: int
    lo: np.ndarray; hi: np.ndarray        # placed part bbox
    anchor_hint: np.ndarray | None = None

@dataclass
class LabelPlacement:
    numeral: int
    key: str
    text_pos: tuple[float, float]
    text_align: str                        # "left" | "right"
    leader: list[tuple[float, float]]      # [anchor_on_part, elbow, landing_end]; 3 points
    score: float

def place_labels(requests: list[LabelRequest], *, obstacles: list[np.ndarray],
                 text_height: float, sheet_lo, sheet_hi) -> list[LabelPlacement]
    """<<ALGORITHM SPECIFIED IN §11 — implement exactly what is written there.>>
    Deterministic: no randomness, stable ordering, stable tie-breaks."""

def text_height_for(slot: float, ratio: float = 0.45) -> float
    """slot * ratio. The QA gate requires height/slot <= 0.6, so 0.45 leaves margin."""
```

Hard postcondition: **zero pairwise overlap among placed numeral boxes**, and no numeral box
intersects any geometry obstacle. Unlike the layout invariant this one **is** genuinely
unsatisfiable for dense inputs, and that is by design: it is the mechanism that forces a figure to
be split rather than allowing the v1 outcome where 97% of numerals overlapped. Raise `LabelError`
carrying `unplaced: list[int]` (the numerals) and `tried: int` (candidate positions per numeral);
the caller turns it into `E_LABELS_UNPLACEABLE` whose hint names the figure id and points at
`assembly.json:split_suggestions`. `place_labels` must never fall back to placing a label anyway.

`obstacles` is every placed geometry polyline in the figure plus every leader and numeral box
already committed during this call — i.e. it grows as the greedy loop proceeds. The caller passes
only the geometry; `place_labels` accumulates the rest itself.

### 5.4 `sheet.py`

    3. Sort the tuples with Python's default tuple ordering — a total order on these values, so no
       tie-break is needed. Do NOT use np.argsort here.
    4. Join with "\n" using repr() of each tuple, encode UTF-8, SHA-256.

    Rounding at 6 decimals and comparing at 6 decimals is the same operation here, so the
    round-then-hash cannot disagree with round-then-compare (a hazard one audit model raised).
    Two runs of the same plan must produce the same digest."""

Every check carries a `hint` that names the plan edit that would fix it, because the model is only
allowed to edit the plan. Example hint for `labels_per_figure`:
`"split fig2 — see assembly.json:split_suggestions"`.

Error codes: `E_SELECTOR_NO_MATCH`, `E_TERM_LOOKS_LIKE_PART_CODE`, `E_TOO_MANY_LABELS`,
`E_MEMBER_NO_MATCH`, `E_DUPLICATE_FIGURE_ID`, `E_UNKNOWN_ENUM`, `E_SCHEMA`, `W_CLAMPED`,
`W_UNLABELLED_PART`.

## 6. CLI surface

Every CLI: `--help` is the contract for agents; `--json` writes machine-readable output; exit 0 on
pass, 1 on failure, 2 on usage error. No CLI ever prints a stack trace as its only output.

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_assembly.py ASM.stp -o assembly.json [--include GLOB]... [--exclude GLOB]...
python3 scripts/validate_figure_plan.py plan.json --assembly assembly.json [--json issues.json]
python3 scripts/render_patent_figure.py plan.json --assembly assembly.json -o out/ \
        [--cache .cache/] [--preview] [--only fig2]
python3 scripts/qa_patent_figure.py out/fig1.dxf [--kind exploded] [--json qa.json]
python3 scripts/doctor.py [--json]
python3 scripts/make_test_assembly.py -o tests/fixtures/synthetic.stp
```

`render_patent_figure.py` writes `out/<figure id>.dxf`, `out/<figure id>.png` (with `--preview`),
and `out/reference-numerals.json`. It runs the QA gate on each figure and exits 1 if any fails,
printing the failing checks with their hints.

## 7. Determinism rules (mandatory, testable)

1. No `random`, no `time`, no `uuid`, no `id()`, no `hash()` of objects in any output-affecting path.
2. Never iterate a `set` or a `dict` built from unsorted input — sort explicitly with a total key.
3. Ties break on a stable secondary key (usually the item's index in a sorted list), never on
   insertion order.
4. Round floats before comparison (`round(v, 9)`); never compare raw floats for equality.
5. Numpy: `np.argsort` defaults to `kind='quicksort'`, which is **not** stable — verified against
   numpy 2.0.2. Always pass `kind="stable"` explicitly. Prefer plain `sorted()` on tuples when the
   data is small; it is stable by definition and needs no flag.
6. Globs: use `fnmatch.fnmatchcase`, never `fnmatch.fnmatch`. `fnmatch` routes through
   `os.path.normcase`, which is identity on macOS/Linux and lowercasing on Windows — verified — so
   the same plan would select different parts on different platforms. This applies to every glob in
   the system: `terms[].selector`, `figures[].members`, `source.include/exclude`.
7. Every module-level constant that affects output lives in **one** place and is named. No magic
   numbers inside function bodies.
8. `normalized_digest` of two runs of the same plan must be equal — `tests/test_golden.py` enforces
   this by rendering twice in one process and once in a subprocess.

## 8. Compliance rules (the R2 fix)

Patent figures carry **only** geometry, leaders, numerals, and the figure caption.
No parts table, no part names, no internal part codes, no dimensions, no title block.
The engineering parts table (`NO./NAME/QTY/REMARK`) is available **only** behind
`layout.engineering_table: true`, is off by default, and files produced with it must be written as
`<id>_engineering.dxf` so a review copy can never be mistaken for a filing copy.

## 9. Reporting format for implementation agents

Return exactly this JSON:

```json
{"files_written": ["scripts/patent_figure/layout.py"],
 "public_api": ["layout_exploded(pieces, axis2d, density, sheet_aspect, max_rows) -> LayoutResult"],
 "decisions": ["gap is a fraction of the median piece extent, not of the total string"],
 "deviations": ["none"],
 "open_issues": ["fit_to_frame margin interacts with label margin — caller must reserve space"],
 "self_test": "python3 -c '...' output summary"}
```

Write real files with the Write tool. Do not print code into the report. Do not run `git`.

## 10. Test fixtures

**Never** use the customer STEP or any real part name in the repository.

`scripts/make_test_assembly.py` is **already written and verified** — do not rewrite it. It emits
`tests/fixtures/synthetic.stp` (64 KB, 8 distinct parts, 11 instances, all named `SYN-*`):

| Part | Shape | Why it is there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYN-A01` | 60×60×6 box | flat base, large footprint |
| `SYN-B02` | ⌀52×18 cylinder | coaxial stack member |
| `SYN-C03` | ⌀18×34 cylinder | tall narrow part — worst case for slot sizing |
| `SYN-D04` | torus R20 r3.5 | silhouette with no B-rep edge (needs `OutLine*`) |
| `SYN-E05` | ⌀44×5 cylinder | thin disc |
| `SYN-F06` | ⌀32 sphere | pure smooth silhouette |
| `SYN-G07` | 44×44×4 box | cover plate |
| `SYN-H08` ×4 | ⌀4×10 cylinder | four instances — exercises qty, `label: once/all/none` |

Verified round trip: `cad_hlr_to_dxf.py tests/fixtures/synthetic.stp --list-parts` reports
`11 instance(s), 8 distinct part(s)` with every `SYN-*` name intact.

**No degenerate part is in the STEP, on purpose.** A bare vertex loses its name in the STEP round
trip and returns labelled with the OCCT version string, which would make the golden digest depend
on the installed OCCT build. Cover the degenerate path in `tests/test_analyze.py` by constructing a
`PartShape` with `lo == hi` directly.

Real-assembly runs happen outside the repo, under the session scratchpad.

### 11.0 模块分工与坐标系（先读这一段，否则 11.3 与 11.7 会互相矛盾）

| 模块 | 坐标系 | 单位 | 知道毫米吗 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layout_exploded` / `layout_assembly` | 已投影的图面 2D 坐标 | **模型单位**（未缩放） | **不知道**。只拿到无量纲的 `sheet_aspect` |
| `fit_to_frame` | 同上 | 输入模型单位，输出纯比例 | 只知道调用方传进来的 `frame_w/frame_h` |
| `place_labels` | 图纸坐标 | **毫米**（已乘 `s` 并平移进图框） | 知道 |
| `render_patent_figure.py` | 两者之间的桥 | 毫米 | 知道 |

**这条分工是硬约束。** 三个候选设计里有两个把「字高不动点」写进了 `layout_exploded` 的函数体，
而该函数的冻结签名只有 `sheet_aspect: float`，函数体内根本拿不到毫米量纲，也拿不到图题带高度。
本节把字高求解整体放在 `render_patent_figure.py`（见 §11.6），`layout_exploded` 只做纯 2D 排布。

渲染主循环（`render_patent_figure.py`，每张图一次）：

```
solve_figure(pieces, axis2d, density, labelled_keys, n_labels, figure_id, kind)
  1. 按 §11.6 对 TEXT_SERIES 做降序扫描，每一档 h：
       lm, cb   = label_margin_mm(h), caption_band_mm(h)
       aw, ah   = FRAME_W - 2*lm, FRAME_H - lm - cb
       result   = layout_exploded(pieces, axis2d, density, sheet_aspect=aw/ah, max_rows=1)
       s        = fit_to_frame(result, aw, ah, margin=0.0)
       接受条件见 §11.6
  2. 接受后：把几何按 s 缩放并居中进 (aw, ah)，图框原点取 FRAME 左下角
  3. sheet_lo/sheet_hi = 整个 FRAME（180x250），不是 (aw, ah)——
     标记允许落进边槽，几何不允许
  4. place_labels(...) 在毫米坐标系里跑
  5. 页面填充闸门在这里判（layout 不判，它不知道毫米）：见 §11.6
```

### 11.1 冲突裁决：单轴一维串 vs 二维排布

**裁决：权威 A 成立。`layout_exploded` 只实现单轴一维串，`max_rows` 只接受 1，传入其它值直接抛
`LayoutError`。权威 B 的「段内错列 / 二维装箱」在本项目中被废止，不实现、不保留降级路径。**
代价是明确的：见本节末「放弃了什么」。

#### 11.1.1 先把两个被三个候选设计一致误用的口径钉死

**【架构师裁决 D1｜占版率的口径】** `geometry_occupancy` = `area(GEOM∪HIDDEN 图层包围盒) /
area(模型空间全部实体包围盒)`。依据：用失败基线反算，几何包围盒 2382×1286.1 = 3.063e6，
全实体包围盒 2576×8791 = 2.265e7，比值 **0.1353**，与报告的 13.5% 逐位吻合；同时明细表包围盒
占比回算得 0.765，与报告的 82.3% 同量级。**该指标是尺度不变的**——把整张图等比放大缩小，
分子分母同步变化，比值不变。因此它度量的是「图面被表格 / 文字 / 边槽稀释了多少」，
**不度量「有没有填满纸」**，也**与 `fit_to_frame` 返回的 `s` 完全无关**。
三个候选设计都拿它当「填版面」指标，因而三份表格全部不可采信。

**【架构师裁决 D2｜新增页面填充闸门】** 既然 D1 不度量填版面，就必须补一条度量填版面的：

```
sheet_fill = area(GEOM∪HIDDEN 图层包围盒) / (aw * ah)          aw, ah = 本图的可用区（mm）
```

**分母是可用区，不是整张 FRAME。** 因为 `fit_to_frame` 恒取最大适配缩放，几何必然贴到可用区的
至少一条边，于是恒等式 `sheet_fill = min(γ/α, α/γ)` 成立（`γ = Gw/Gh` 是几何图面长宽比，
`α = aw/ah` 是可用区长宽比）。也就是说这条闸门度量的是**几何长宽比与纸张长宽比的匹配度**，
而在「恒取最大适配」的前提下，匹配度就等价于填版面程度。
分母若取整张 FRAME，正方形几何在任何字号档下都只能得到 0.487~0.513，**结构性地过不了 0.55**，
而正方形几何的长宽比是旋转不变的（`Gw = Gh = L(|cosθ|+|sinθ|)` 对任意 θ 成立），
错误提示里的「改 axis_angle」会推荐一个什么都改变不了的编辑，用户原地打转——
那是把「双重留边」那类标定错误在更高一层重演。取可用区作分母则正方形得 0.679~0.685，正常通过。

DXF 以毫米写出（`$INSUNITS=4`，§5.4 强制），`h` 可从 `NUM` 图层的 TEXT 实体直接读到，
`aw/ah` 由 §11.6 的 `label_margin_mm(h) / caption_band_mm(h)` 闭式还原，所以 qa.py 完全算得出来。
阈值 `sheet_fill_min = 0.55`，与 `geometry_occupancy_min` 同值。
**本节全部「占版率」论证都指 `sheet_fill`。**

**【架构师裁决 D3｜字高闸门的真实口径】** 契约冻结的 `text_height_for(slot, 0.45) = slot*0.45`
使 `text_height/slot ≡ 0.45 ≤ 0.6` **恒成立**——这道闸门是自指的，永远不会因为字太小而报警。
基线的 1.74 是旧代码把字高按整图 `size*0.022` 取比例造成的，签名本身已经消灭了那个 bug。
所以真正有判别力的是**绝对字高**：新增 `text_height_mm_min = 3.5`（GB/T 14691 数字最小字号，
也是专利附图缩印后仍可辨认的下限）。由 `h ≥ 3.5` 与 `h/slot ≤ 0.6` 反解得
**被标注件的图面外廓必须 ≥ 3.5/0.6 = 5.833 mm**，这才是那道闸门真正在管的事。

#### 11.1.2 一维串在什么条件下够用——把账算完

图幅：`FRAME_W×FRAME_H = 180×250 mm`（A4 竖版减 15 mm 边距，§5.2 冻结）。
扣掉标记边槽与图题带后的可用区 `aw×ah` 见 §11.2 的 `label_margin_mm/caption_band_mm`。
零件沿轴足迹 `w_i`，间隙 `G = DENSITY[density] * median(w)`（§5.2 冻结语义），
串沿轴总长 `L = Σw_i + (n-1)G`，垂轴宽 `V`。图面轴对齐包围盒：

```
Gw = L*|cos θ| + V*|sin θ|        Gh = L*|sin θ| + V*|cos θ|        θ = axis_angle
s  = min(aw/Gw, ah/Gh)            sheet_fill = min(γ/α, α/γ),  γ = Gw/Gh,  α = aw/ah
```

`sheet_fill` 在 `γ = α` 时取极大。闭式解为

```
tan|θ*| = (L - alpha*V) / (alpha*L - V)          θ* = 180° - atan(...)   （θ ∈ (90°,180°)）
```

（**不要解 `Gw/Gh = alpha` 的等式的化简形式**：当 `alpha*L - V → 0`，即串的长宽比恰为 `1/alpha`
时该式奇异；`L/V` 落在 `[alpha, 1/alpha]` 区间内时根本无解，因为这么胖的块在任何旋转下
都达不到 `alpha` 的长宽比。此时按 §11.3 S9 的 1° 定步长扫描取最优角，见常数 `ANGLE_GRID_DEG`。）

实算（等尺寸件、`density=normal`、`h=3.5` 档的 `aw×ah = 152×222`、`alpha = 0.6847`）：

| 143.5° | 6.062 | 152.0×114.7 | 1.325 | **0.517** | 6.06 | 2.73 | **sheet_fill 不达标** |
| **152°（现默认）** | 5.557 | 152.0×84.3 | 1.802 | **0.380** | 5.56 | 2.50 | **不达标，且槽位 5.56 < 5.833** |

| 180° | 4.992 | 152.0×5.0 | 30.45 | **0.022** | 4.99 | 2.25 | **不达标** |

**结论一：`axis_angle` 的现默认值 152° 是失败基线里除明细表之外的第二个真凶。**
在 152° 下几何只吃掉可用区的 38%（对整张 A4 只有 28.5%），纸的高度方向 2/3 是空的。
`references/cad-source-to-drawing.md` §4 推荐的「150–160° 对竖直装配轴读起来舒服」是目视经验，
在 A4 **竖版**上被测量证伪：竖版要求串更陡。

**【架构师裁决 D4】`layout.axis_angle` 的默认值由 152 改为 124。** 该值落在 §4.2 冻结的
夹紧区间 `[120,180]` 内，且正是权威 A 自己开的药方（"To get a diagonal string on the sheet,
roll the view instead"），不需要任何横向位移。`roll_for_axis()`（§5.1 已有闭式解）负责把它变成
`ViewFrame.roll`。三档字号下 `θ*` 分别为 124.17° / 124.17° / 124.40°，取整为 **124**，
对字号档位不敏感，这就是它能当默认值的原因。`sheet_fill ≥ 0.55` 的可行窗口约为 `[120°, 141°]`，
`θ*` 稳稳落在窗口中部。

**结论二：件数上限（等尺寸件，θ=124°，density=normal）。**

| N | 接受字号 h | s | sheet_fill | 槽位 mm | h/槽位 | 判定 |

| 30 | — | 5.73 | 0.998 | 5.73 | — | **LayoutError：槽位 5.73 < 5.833** |

**在 θ=124° 下，单轴一维串可容纳 29 个等尺寸零件实例**，而 §4.2 的标记上限是 20 个标记。
所以在「零件尺寸不悬殊」这一类输入上，一维串有 45% 的件数余量，二维排布带来的额外空间
**买不到任何一道闸门的通过**。为一个买不到收益的目标去破坏装配关系，是拿正确性换零。

#### 11.1.3 必须承认的两件事（不粉饰）

**(1) 「20 个标记」不等于「20 个零件」。** §4.2 的规则原文是 *Effective label count per figure*；
`label: "once"`（同名件只标一次）、`label: "none"`（标准件不标）加上 `members: ["*"]`，
使「90 个实例 / 20 个标记」成为完全合法的 plan，`E_TOO_MANY_LABELS` 不会触发。
**零件数在契约里没有上限，因此必须由 §11.6 的字高求解补上这道闸门**，
失败消息要明说「标记数没超、件数超了」，否则这条阈值会被绕过。

**(2) 尺寸悬殊时一维串确实会输给二维排布，而我选择输。**
实测一组 6:1 尺寸分布的 20 件栈（沿轴足迹 60…10，最小**被标注**件 18 单位）：

| axis_angle | density | s | sheet_fill | 被标注件最小槽位 | 判定 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 124° | compact | 19.56 | 0.956 | 5.87 mm | 通过（余量仅 0.6%） |
| 124° | normal | 17.49 | 0.962 | 5.25 mm | **LayoutError（< 5.833）** |
| 135° | normal | 14.27 | 0.685 | 4.28 mm | LayoutError |
| 152° | normal | 11.80 | 0.398 | 3.54 mm | LayoutError（两条闸门同时失败） |

同一批零件按面积二维装箱可得约 3 倍的比例尺（`sqrt(Area/N)` vs `D_frame/N`，N=20 时理论 3.1 倍），
能把 5.25 mm 抬到 15 mm 以上，一张图就装下了。**我放弃这个收益。** 理由：

- 分解图的法律功能是表达装配关系。把零件推离它自己的轴，读图者无法再判断「谁装进谁、谁与谁同轴」，
  这一项不可交易；`references` §4 的禁令保护的正是它。
- 二维排布并不是这类输入的正确解药。真正的病因是「一颗 18 单位的小件被要求带标记」，
  正确的 plan 编辑是 `label: "none"`（标准件不标）、或按 `assembly.json:split_suggestions` 拆图、
  或 `density: "compact"`。这三条编辑模型都能做，而「把零件推离轴」模型做不了、也不该做。
- 代价量化：这条裁决会让「尺寸跨度 > 3:1 且小件需要标记」的装配体多出 1~2 张附图。
  多一张附图的成本远低于一张关系失真的附图。

**(3) 我不主张一维串在所有角度都赢。** 上表白纸黑字：152° 下一维串六项里输两项。
这条裁决**是有条件的**，条件就是 D4——`axis_angle` 默认必须改到 124°。
若有人坚持保留 152°，本裁决作废，那时应当拆图，仍然不是横向位移。

#### 11.1.4 放弃了什么（写进 report 的 decisions）

- 放弃 `max_rows > 1`：不实现二维排布，传 >1 抛 `LayoutError`（**绝不静默降级成一维串**——
  静默降级会让「记得传参的调用方」和「忘了传的调用方」渲染出两张不同的图而两边都通过 QA）。
- 放弃 `references` §4 建议的 150–160° 观感，换取竖版填充率；理由与实测见 11.1.2。
- 放弃「尺寸悬殊时把小件也塞进同一张图」，改为报错并给出三条可执行的 plan 编辑。

### 11.2 常数表

**规则：函数体内不得出现任何裸数字**（`0`、`1`、`2`、`0.5` 这类无量纲结构常数除外）。
下表每一行都必须能在实现里以同名常量出现，且只定义一次（§7 规则 7）。

#### 11.2.1 `layout.py`

| 名字 | 值 | 从哪个约束反解出来 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DENSITY` | `{"compact":0.35, "normal":0.55, "loose":0.85}` | **§5.2 冻结原值，逐位照抄。** 语义同样冻结：**中位 body 沿爆炸方向足迹的比例，不是串总长的比例**。三个候选设计都误抄成 0.035/0.055/0.085（差 10 倍）并都误用了「总跨度」语义——后者正是 v1「串越长每件槽位越小而间隙越大」的失败机理，§5.2 注释已点名 |
| `FRAME_W, FRAME_H` | `180.0, 250.0` | §5.2 冻结：A4 竖版减 15 mm 边距 |
| `RANK_DEC` | `9` | §7 规则 4 |
| `EPS_REL` | `1e-9` | 一切比较先做 `Q(v) = round(v / SCALE_REF, RANK_DEC)`。float64 相对精度 2.2e-16，留 7 个数量级吸收 ≤1e5 次运算的累积舍入。**必须是相对量**：`layout.py` 拿到的是模型单位，同一装配体以 m 或以 mm 导出，绝对 `round(v,9)` 要么完全不起作用要么过度合并 |
| `OVERLAP_TOL_REL` | `1e-6` | §5.2 冻结的 `1e-6` 重叠容差，改写为 `1e-6 * SCALE_REF`（同上理由；偏离见 §11.10） |
| `DEGEN_REL` | `1e-6` | §5.1 `PartShape.degenerate` 的定义（max extent < 1e-6），同样改写为相对量 |
| `AXIS_MIN_NORM` | `1e-3` | `axis2d` 是**单位** 3D 轴在图面上的投影，模长天然落在 `[0,1]`，故这里用绝对值合法。低于 1e-3 时图面方向不足 3 位有效数字，而 `_sep_required` 要除以它的分量。legacy 用 1e-6：`k=1e-5` 时位移被放大 1e5 倍且不报错 |
| `AXIS_COMP_MIN` | `1e-3` | 同上，逐分量版本。`_sep_required` 里除以 `e[k]`，`|e[k]| < 1e-3` 的那一支放大 >1e3 倍，直接跳过（跳过是安全的：该支给出的 `t` 本来就是天文数字，`min()` 不会选它） |
| `ANGLE_LO, ANGLE_HI` | `120.0, 180.0` | §4.2 冻结的 `axis_angle` 夹紧区间 |
| `ANGLE_GRID_DEG` | `1.0` | 闭式 `θ*` 无解时的定步长扫描分辨率。plan 里 `axis_angle` 以整数度书写，1° 就是可表达的最小改动，再细没有意义。定步长 61 次求值 ⇒ 确定、无收敛判据 |
| `SLOT_QA_CAP_K` | `1.2` | `qa` 若按「几何包围盒对角 / 标记数」度量 slot（失败基线的算法），要保证 `0.45*slot ≤ 0.6*(diag/N)` 需 `slot ≤ 1.333*diag/N`；退 10% 余量取 1.2。一行成本换两种口径都过闸 |
| `AXIS_ANGLE_DEFAULT` | `124` | 【架构师裁决 D4】三档字号下闭式 `θ*` = 124.17/124.17/124.40，取整。见 11.1.2 |

#### 11.2.2 版面求解常数（定义在 `layout.py`，由 `render_patent_figure.py` 使用）

| 名字 | 值 | 从哪个约束反解出来 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TEXT_SERIES` | `(7.0, 5.0, 3.5)` | GB/T 14691 字高系列 `1.8/2.5/3.5/5/7/10/14/20` 中适用于专利附图标记的三档。降序排列是 §11.6 扫描方向的前提 |
| `TEXT_FLOOR_MM` | `3.5` | GB/T 14691 数字最小字号；2.5 mm 缩印至 2/3 只剩 1.67 mm，受理后不可辨认。**待核对现行《专利审查指南》原文，与 iteration-plan §7.5 的保留一致** |
| `TEXT_RATIO` | `0.45` | §5.3 冻结的 `text_height_for` 默认比值，为 QA 的 0.6 留 25% 余量 |
| `QA_TEXT_SLOT_MAX` | `0.6` | §5.5 `text_slot_ratio_max` |
| `SLOT_FLOOR_MM` | `TEXT_FLOOR_MM / QA_TEXT_SLOT_MAX` = `5.8333…` | 派生量，不单独取值。被标注件的图面外廓下限 |
| `LABEL_MARGIN_K` | `4.0`（×h） | 一个从几何边缘朝外伸出的标记要占：`RING_BASE_K(1.0) + LAND_K(2.0) + RUNOUT_K(0.5) + PAD_X(0.3)` = 3.8h，取 4.0h |
| `LABEL_MARGIN_CAP_MM` | `16.0` | = 8.9% × `FRAME_W`。再大则两侧边槽合计吃掉 18% 版宽，可用区面积占比跌到 0.70 以下，对 `sheet_fill` 余量不足。该封顶只在 h ≥ 5 时起作用 |
| `CAPTION_K` | `4.0`（×h） | 图题带 = 图题字高 `CAPTION_RATIO*h` + 上下净空各 1.2h = 4.0h |
| `CAPTION_CAP_MM` | `16.0` | 同 `LABEL_MARGIN_CAP_MM` |
| `CAPTION_RATIO` | `1.6` | 图题比附图标记大一档半，是国内机械制图的通行做法；同时保证 h=3.5 时图题 5.6 mm 仍在 GB 系列的可读区 |
| `SHEET_FILL_MIN` | `0.55` | 【架构师裁决 D2】新增闸门。`sheet_fill = 几何包围盒面积 / (aw*ah) = min(γ/α, α/γ)`。分母取**可用区**而不是整张 FRAME：后者会让正方形几何在任何字号档下只得 0.487~0.513，结构性不可达，而正方形的长宽比旋转不变，错误提示里的「改 axis_angle」什么也改变不了 |

#### 11.2.3 `labels.py`（全部以字高 `h` 为单位表达，因此与纸张、比例尺、零件数无关）

| 名字 | 值 | 从哪个约束反解出来 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RANK_DEC` | `9` | §7 规则 4 |
| `EPS_SHEET_REL` | `1e-9` | 比较容差 = `1e-9 * 图框对角`。同 `EPS_REL` 的理由 |
| `N_DIRS` | `12` | 30° 栅格。GB/T 4457.2 认可的指引线角度集合是 30/45/60/90° 的倍数；30° 是该集合的最小公倍步长 |
| `PHASE_DEG` | `15.0` | 相位偏置使候选角为 15/45/…/345°，**没有一个是 0° 或 90°**。GB/T 4457.2 要求指引线不得水平、竖直、或平行于轮廓线。附带好处：`d[0]` 与 `d[1]` 恒非零，`_ray_exit_aabb` 不需要除零分支 |
| `DIR_ROUND_DEC` | `12` | 模块导入时把 12 个方向的 `cos/sin` `round` 到 12 位。libm 的三角函数误差在 1 ULP（相对 ~1e-16）量级，round 到 1e-12 后被完全吸收，任何平台得到同一组常量 |
| `CHAR_W` | `0.71` | GB/T 14691 B 型字宽 = `h/√2` = 0.7071，向上取 0.71（宁可把数字框算宽，不可算窄） |
| `PAD_X` | `0.30`（×h） | GB 字距 `a = 0.2h`。两个数字框水平净距 = `2*PAD_X*h = 0.6h = 3` 倍字距 ⇒ 相邻的 "1" 与 "2" 不会被读成 "12" |
| `PAD_Y` | `0.20`（×h） | 行高 = `h + 2*PAD_Y*h = 1.4h` = GB/T 14691 B 型最小行距 |
| `LAND_K` | `2.0`（×h） | GB/T 4457.2：基准线不短于所注文字长度。两位数字宽 `2*0.71h = 1.42h`，取 2.0h 使其读作「线」而非「钩」 |
| `RUNOUT_K` | `0.50`（×h） | 文字与基准线端点的间隙 = 2.5 倍字距。修掉 legacy `gen_exploded.py` L134「数字放在基准线中点却用端对齐 ⇒ 文字压线」 |
| `RING_BASE_K` | `1.0`（×h） | 第 0 圈候选距零件包围盒的距离：至少让开一个字高，引线才看得见起点 |
| `RING_GROWTH` | `1.8` | 几何级数比。四圈覆盖 `1.0 / 1.8 / 3.24 / 5.83` h |
| `RING_COUNT` | `4` | 外圈 5.83h：再远则引线本身比标记足迹还长，读作杂线 |
| `GRID_CELL_K` | `4.0`（×h） | 障碍索引网格边长。数字框最大边约 `2*CHAR_W*h + 2*PAD_X*h ≈ 2.0h`，故一个框最多覆盖 2×2 个格 |
| `CLEAR_K` | `0.50`（×h） | 打分用的「擦边」膨胀量：数字框外扩 0.5h 后仍碰到几何 ⇒ 判为擦边 |
| `CROWD_R_K` | `3.0`（×h） | 拥挤统计半径。3h ≈ 两个数字框的对角，超出此距离视觉上不再成组 |
| `W_LEN` | `1.0` | 打分基准：引线每长 1h 记 1 分。以下三项都是「等价于多少 h 引线长度」的显式汇率，不是拟合值 |
| `W_DIR` | `2.0` | 方向偏离首选方向 60°（`1-cos60° = 0.5`）记 1.0 分 = 1h 引线 |
| `W_CLR` | `3.0` | 擦几何记 3 分：宁可多绕 3 个字高也不擦线 |
| `W_CROWD` | `2.0` | 每有一个已落位数字框落在 `CROWD_R_K*h` 内记 2 分 |
| `MAX_REPAIR` | `3` | 有界回退轮数。每轮至少禁掉一个已落位候选，禁集单调增长 ⇒ 必终止；3 轮之后仍无解说明这张图过载，应当拆图而不是继续挤 |

**关于 `max_rows`**：本实现恒返回 `rows = 1`。这不是 deviation，是 §11.1 的裁决；
传入 `max_rows != 1` 是**错误**而不是提示，因为静默降级会产生「两个调用方两张图都通过 QA」
的可复现性失败。

**关于 HLR 粒度（必须写进实现说明）**：body 内部成员的图面包围盒允许相交（螺栓圈就是如此），
因此 §5.1 的 `part_curves`（逐件 HLR，仅对图面互不相交的件有效）在 body 内部**不成立**。
必须对每个 body 调用一次 `scene_curves(body.members, ...)`，让体内遮挡被正确计算；
body 之间由后置条件 P1 保证图面不相交，故分组求解与整体一次求解结果等价，可安全分片缓存。
这与 legacy `gen_exploded` 的「逐零件 HLR」不同：后者的等价性前提当年并不成立，
本设计是**先用后置条件把该前提证成，再享用它**。

### 11.5 `fit_to_frame` 伪代码

**【架构师裁决 D5】§5.2 描述的 `s = min(s_fit, s_target)` 中的 `s_target` 分支在本节被废止，
`margin` 的默认值由 0.06 改为 0.0。** 三个理由，缺一不可：

1. `s_target` 把几何面积钉死在 `TARGET_OCCUPANCY = 0.62` 的可用区。而 §11.1 裁决 D1 已证明
   `geometry_occupancy` 是**尺度不变**的——等比缩放不改变它分毫。所以 `s_target` **改善不了
   任何一道 QA 闸门**，只会白白把线性比例尺压掉 `sqrt(0.62) = 21%`，进而把字高压掉 21%。
   实测：N=20 时 `0.45×slot` 由 3.83 降到 3.02，直接跌破 `TEXT_FLOOR_MM = 3.5`。
2. `margin=0.06` 是双重内缩：`FRAME_W×FRAME_H = 180×250` 本身已经是「A4 减 15 mm 边距」的可用区，
   而标记边槽与图题带由调用方按 §11.6 从 `frame_w/frame_h` 里**显式扣除**后再传进来。
   两者叠加会把可用面积压到 77.4%，几何再也够不到纸的边。
3. `s_target` 存在的目的（给标记留出余量）已经由 §11.6 的 `label_margin_mm/caption_band_mm` 承担，
   而且承担得更准：那是按**当前字号**算出来的实际需求，不是一个拍出来的 0.62。

```python
def fit_to_frame(result, frame_w=FRAME_W, frame_h=FRAME_H, margin=0.0):
    """返回等比缩放因子 s，使几何包围盒恰好装进 (frame_w, frame_h) 内缩 margin 之后的区域。

### 11.6 `text_height_for` 的推导与字高求解

#### 11.6.1 冻结函数原样保留

    """§5.3 冻结：slot * ratio。QA 要求 height/slot <= 0.6，0.45 留 25% 余量。
    注意这是**原始**字高，还没有吸附到 GB 字号系列，也没有做绝对下限检查。"""
    return slot * ratio
```

#### 11.6.2 三个 slot 必须区分清楚（三个候选设计都在这里接错了线）

| 名字 | 定义 | 谁用 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LayoutResult.slot` | `min(min over **all** pieces of max(hi-lo), SLOT_QA_CAP_K*diag/N)` | 契约字面值 + 双口径夹紧，写进报告与诊断，**不直接喂给 text_height_for** |
| `slot_labelled`（模型单位） | `min over pieces **that carry a numeral** of max(hi-lo)`，由 renderer 从 `diagnostics["extent_by_key"]` 与 `Numbering` 交叉算出 | **喂给 `text_height_for` 的就是它 × s** |
| `slot_qa`（qa.py 观测） | 见 §11.10 对 qa.py 的修订要求 | qa.py |

理由：附图标记的字高只需相对**它所指的那个零件**可读。一个 `label:"none"` 的垫圈不该把全图数字压小。
契约自带的 `label` 三态就是为这个场景准备的逃生阀。这是对 §5.2 `slot` 语义的显式偏离，
必须写进实现报告的 `deviations`，并在 `diagnostics["slot_labelled"]` 留痕供 qa 交叉核对。

#### 11.6.3 字高的降序扫描（消除 h ↔ 边槽 ↔ s ↔ h 的循环依赖）

`h` 决定边槽与图题带宽 ⇒ 决定 `aw/ah` ⇒ 决定 `s` ⇒ 决定 `slot_sheet` ⇒ 决定 `h`。这是个环。
因为 `h` 的取值域是**有限有序集** `TEXT_SERIES`，且映射 `h ↦ snap(0.45 * slot_sheet(h))`
关于 `h` 单调非增，**降序扫描取第一个自洽值**即为最大可行解：至多 3 步，必然终止，
**不会像浮点不动点那样在两个值之间振荡**。

#### 11.6.4 为什么 `text_height/slot <= 0.6` 是**构造性**成立的

`h = snap(0.45 * slot_sheet) ≤ 0.45 * slot_sheet`，故比值 ≤ 0.45 < 0.6，与零件数、纸张、
`axis_angle` 全部无关。走 floor override 分支时 `h = 3.5` 且 `slot_sheet ≥ 3.5/0.6`，
故比值 ≤ 0.6，仍然成立。**这道闸门不可能失败**——这也正是它没有判别力、必须补
`text_height_mm_min` 与 `sheet_fill` 两条的原因（§11.1 裁决 D2/D3）。

### 11.7 `place_labels` 伪代码

**坐标系：毫米图纸坐标。** `requests` 的 `lo/hi`、`obstacles`、`sheet_lo/sheet_hi` 都已由 renderer
乘过 `s` 并平移进图框。`sheet_lo/sheet_hi` 是整个 `FRAME`（180×250），不是几何可用区——
标记允许落进边槽，几何不允许。

#### 11.7.1 为什么「引线零交叉」是不变量而不是统计结果

`_dyn_ok` 把「与任一已落位引线相交」以及「穿过任一已落位数字框」都列为**硬否决**，
回退分支同样调用 `_dyn_ok`，所以最终集合里不可能存在交叉对。
**因此不需要 2-opt 交换阶段，也不需要论证它收敛**——候选设计里的相邻交换修复没有严格递减
不变量，可能在可解输入上跑满 `n²` 轮然后抛错。L8 的复验只用来抓实现错误。

#### 11.7.2 `anchor_hint` 与锚点悬空（诚实说明残留缺陷）

`LabelRequest` 只有 `lo/hi`，`obstacles` 又不归属零件，所以在没有 `anchor_hint` 时，
锚点只能取射线与零件 AABB 的交点——对凹形件（L 形、U 形）它可能悬在零件本体之外。
这是 legacy `gen_exploded.py` L120 的老毛病在冻结签名下的残留。缓解：

- **renderer 必须提供 `anchor_hint`**，配方固定为：取该件放置后自身可见曲线的全部采样点，
  选沿「件中心 − 图形质心」方向投影最大者；并列时取 `(round(x,9), round(y,9))` 字典序最小的点。
  该点必然落在真实轮廓上。
- `place_labels` 用它做两件事：定首选方向；并作为「偏离最小的那个方向」的锚点。
  其余方向仍走 AABB 射线（它们本来就是回退级候选，被选中的概率低）。
- `anchor_hint is None` 时，renderer 必须在 `report.open_issues` / `diagnostics` 里标记为降级。
- 修掉的 legacy 缺陷：L118 的 `abs((hi-lo)@perp)/2` 在 perp 两分量异号时坍缩到真值的 7%
  （锚点掉进零件内部）——本设计不再用包围盒代数推锚点；
  L123-129 的落脚线朝向判据恒等于 `perp[0] <= 0`（全图同向）——本设计的 `sgn` 逐候选判断；
  L134 把数字放在落脚线中点却用端对齐（文字压线）——本设计放在端点外 `RUNOUT_K*h` 处。

#### 11.7.3 `sheet.py` 侧的配合

- `leader` 的三个点写成一条 LWPOLYLINE，图层 `LEADER`，CONTINUOUS。
- 锚点处画 GB/T 4457.2 的小圆点（实心点，直径 `0.15*h`）——该常数属于 `sheet.py`，
  在那里定义，不进 `labels.py`。
- 数字用 `MIDDLE_LEFT` / `MIDDLE_RIGHT` 对齐，插入点即 `text_pos`；
  `text_align == "left"` ⇒ `MIDDLE_LEFT`。
- 斜引线永远不会是水平或竖直（`PHASE_DEG=15`）；水平的那一段是**基准线**，
  GB 惯例如此，不是违规。

### 11.8 不变量与异常

| # | 不变量 | 在哪里检查 | 违反时抛什么 | 消息里必须带 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | 零横向位移：任一 piece 的 `offset · p == 0` | `layout_exploded` S8 | `LayoutError` | piece key |
| P1 | body 之间图面包围盒两两不重叠（容差 `OVERLAP_TOL_REL*SCALE_REF`） | `layout_exploded` S8 | `LayoutError` | 重叠对数 + 首例两个 body key；注明「这是实现错误」 |
| P2 | 数字框两两不重叠 | `place_labels` L4 构造 + L8 复验 | `LabelError` | 两个 numeral |
| P3 | 数字框不压任何几何障碍 | L3 构造 + L8 复验 | `LabelError` | numeral |
| P4 | 数字框在 `sheet_lo/sheet_hi` 内 | L3 构造 + L8 复验 | `LabelError` | numeral |
| P5 | 引线两两不交叉 | L4 构造 + L8 复验 | `LabelError` | 两个 numeral |
| P5b | 引线不穿过**任何已落位的数字框**（§5.3 明文：obstacles 含已提交的引线与数字框） | L4 构造 + L8 复验 | `LabelError` | 两个 numeral |
| P6 | 引线不穿过另一个被标注零件的 AABB | L3 构造 | 无（候选被否决） | — |
| P7 | 页面填充 `sheet_fill >= SHEET_FILL_MIN` | `solve_figure`（renderer） | `LayoutError` | 实测 fill、几何 mm 尺寸、γ 与 α、`axis_angle_opt`、可执行的 plan 编辑 |
| P8 | 字高 `>= TEXT_FLOOR_MM` | `solve_figure`（renderer） | `LayoutError` | 最大可用字高、被标注件最小外廓、**件数与标记数并列**、四条 plan 编辑 |

**失败模式清单（每一条都必须有出口，不许静默降级）：**

| 输入 | 行为 |
| --- | --- |
| `pieces` 为空 / `density` 未知 / `sheet_aspect <= 0` | `LayoutError`，点名参数 |
| `max_rows != 1` | `LayoutError`，说明二维排布已废止 + 三条替代动作。**绝不降级成一维串** |
| 某 piece `curves` 为空（`occ_backend` 三处 `except Exception: pass` 会静默丢曲线） | `LayoutError`，点名 key，提示 exclude 或换 view。不当成零尺寸件塞进布局 |
| 曲线含 NaN/Inf | `LayoutError`，点名 key。**必须在排布前拦**：NaN 让所有比较返回 False，重叠检查会「假通过」 |
| 退化件（外廓 < `DEGEN_REL × SCALE_REF`） | `LayoutError`，列出全部 key，提示 `source.exclude`。legacy 在此处抛的是无信息的 `max() arg is an empty sequence` |
| `|axis2d| < AXIS_MIN_NORM` | `LayoutError`，报实测模长与阈值，提示改 view / explode_axis |
| 全体几何退化为一点 | `LayoutError` |
| `sheet_fill < 0.55` 且旋转能救（`axis_angle_opt` 与当前角差 ≥ 1°） | `LayoutError`（P7），首选建议改 `axis_angle`。**修复建议永远不准是横向位移** |
| `sheet_fill < 0.55` 但当前角已是最优（近正方形几何，长宽比旋转不变；`kind='assembly'` 常见） | `LayoutError`（P7），建议换 `layout.view` 或拆图，**不得推荐改 axis_angle**（那是一个什么都改变不了的编辑，会让用户原地打转） |
| 被标注件最小外廓 < `SLOT_FLOOR_MM` | `LayoutError`（P8），必须明说「标记数没超、件数超了，E_TOO_MANY_LABELS 不会触发」 |
| 标记落不下 | `LabelError(unplaced=[...], tried=48)`；调用方转 `E_LABELS_UNPLACEABLE`，hint 指向 `assembly.json:split_suggestions` |
| 同名实例跨工位被误并成一个 body | 由 S4 的**轴向区间聚类**规避。实现者若把它简化成「同名即一体」，壳体上下各 4 颗同型螺钉会并出一个横跨壳体的包围盒，位移荒谬——这是必现故障点 |
| `axis_angle` 落在 `[120,180]` 但闭式 `θ*` 无解（串太胖） | 不报错，`_closed_form_best_angle` 退回 1° 定步长扫描。**不要去解 `Gw/Gh = alpha` 的等式**：它在 `L/V = 1/alpha` 处奇异，会在合法输入上误抛 |

### 11.9 确定性检查清单（实现者逐条勾选）

- [ ] **1** 全代码无 `random` / `time` / `uuid` / `id()` / 对象 `hash()`。所有「选择」都是对**有限有序候选表**的下标扫描（`TEXT_SERIES` 3 档、`CAND[i]` 48 条、角度栅格 61 步）。
- [ ] **2** 没有一处裸的 `for k in some_dict` 或 `for x in some_set`。`GRID` 只做 `.get()` 点查；`banned` 只做 `in` 成员测试；`chosen` 每次遍历都写 `for j in sorted(chosen)`；零件名遍历写 `sorted({...})`；`labelled_keys` 遍历写 `sorted(...)`。
- [ ] **3** 每个排序键都是**全序**，末位是全局唯一量（`piece.key` / `body.key` / `numeral` / 候选下标 `idx`）。逐一核对：body 内实例排序 `(Q(alo), Q(ahi), key)`；bodies 排序 `(Q(ac), Q(alo), key)`；标记次序 `(len(STATIC), Q(area), numeral)`；候选择优 `(score, idx)`；方向排序 `(Q(-cosΔ), k)`。
- [ ] **4** 比较前一律量化。`layout.py` 用相对算子 `Q(v) = round(v/SCALE_REF, 9)`（包括 P0 断言、body 聚类合并判据、`_sep_required` 的 `t <= 0` 分支、P1 的包围盒相交判定）；`labels.py` 用 `round(v, 9)` 配 `EPS = 1e-9 × 图框对角`（包括 `_seg_cross` 的四个叉积符号）。**没有一处裸浮点相等或大小比较。**
- [ ] **5** 没有写过 `P @ e`。所有 (M,2)·(2,) 投影都走 `_dot2` 的逐元素形式（BLAS gemv 的分块与线程数随机器变，浮点加法不结合 ⇒ 末位会变）。同理不对大数组用 `np.sum` / `np.mean`；需要求和的地方用 Python `sum()` 对**已 round 的 float 列表**按固定顺序累加。
- [ ] **6** 没有用 `np.median`（introselect 分区路径随版本变）。中位数走 `_lower_median`：`sorted(...)[(n-1)//2]`，偶数长度**不做**两值平均。
- [ ] **7** 三角函数只在两处出现：`_DIRS` 常量（模块导入时 `round` 到 12 位）与 `_closed_form_best_angle`（结果 `round` 到 9 位再比较/输出）。`min`/`max`/`sqrt`/`hypot` 与四则运算是 IEEE-754 正确舍入的，不需要处理。
- [ ] **8** 若用到 `np.argsort` / `np.sort`，一律显式 `kind="stable"`（§7 规则 5，numpy 2.0.2 默认 quicksort 不稳定）。`np.argmax` 并列返回最小下标是文档保证的，但取值前先 `np.round`。
- [ ] **9** 所有循环都**有界且定次**：`TEXT_SERIES` 3 档；角度栅格 `int((180-120)/1)+1 = 61` 步；回退 `MAX_REPAIR+1 = 4` 轮且 `banned` 单调增长；没有任何 `while` 与容差退出判据（容差退出会因浮点累积在不同 CPU 上多跑或少跑一轮）。
- [ ] **10** 影响输出的常量全部在模块顶部命名定义，函数体内无裸数字（`0/1/2/0.5` 这类结构常数除外），且每个都能在 §11.2 找到反解来源。
- [ ] **11** 写进 `Piece.offset` 与 `LabelPlacement` 的坐标 `round` 到 9~12 位，而 `normalized_digest` 只保留 6 位 ⇒ 至少 3 个数量级的安全带。
- [ ] **12** **上游依赖已锚定**：本模块的确定性建立在 `PartShape.key` 稳定之上（§5.1：`load_assembly` 按 `(name, path, round(c,6))` 排序**之后**才分配 `instance_index`）。若上游没做到，本模块也保不住。写进 `open_issues`，并在测试里锚定。
- [ ] **13** `tests/test_layout.py` 断言 **bitwise** 相等，不是 `allclose`：同一输入在同进程跑两次 + 子进程跑一次，`np.array([p.offset for p in pieces]).tobytes()` 三者完全相同。
- [ ] **14** `tests/test_layout.py` 加**输入置换测试**：把 `pieces` 列表做 5 种置换（`key` 不变）重跑，要求输出逐位相同。这才验证得了第 3 条的全序键真的把插入序兜死了——重复跑同一输入验证不了。
- [ ] **15** `tests/test_labels.py` 同样做两条：100 次重跑序列化结果字符串完全相同；`requests` 列表置换后结果不变。

### 11.10 对冻结条目的偏离与对其它模块的修订要求（架构师裁决汇总）

实现 agent 必须把下表逐条抄进报告的 `deviations`。

| # | 条目 | 冻结原文 | 本节裁定 | 理由 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `fit_to_frame` 的 `s_target` | §5.2 `s = min(s_fit, s_target)` | **废止 `s_target`，`s = s_fit`** | `geometry_occupancy` 尺度不变，`s_target` 改善不了任何闸门，只把字高压掉 21% 并跌破 3.5 mm 下限。见 §11.5 |
| 2 | `fit_to_frame` 的 `margin` 默认值 | §5.2 `margin = 0.06` | **改为 `0.0`**，调用方必须传 0.0 | 180×250 已经是可用区；边槽与图题带由 §11.6 显式扣除。双重内缩后几何再也够不到纸的边 |
| 3 | `LayoutResult.slot` | §5.2 `min over pieces of max(hi-lo)` | **`min(该值, SLOT_QA_CAP_K*diag/N)`**；另在 `diagnostics["slot_labelled"]` 上报「被标注件的最小外廓」，**由后者驱动字高** | 一颗 `label:"none"` 的垫圈不该把全图数字压小；双口径夹紧让两种可能的 qa 实现都过闸 |
| 4 | `layout_exploded` 的 `max_rows` | §5.2 默认 1，语义为上限 | **只接受 1，其它值抛 `LayoutError`** | §11.1 裁决：不实现二维排布，且绝不静默降级 |
| 5 | 重叠容差 | §5.2 `1e-6` | **`1e-6 × SCALE_REF`**（相对量） | `layout.py` 拿的是模型单位，绝对容差在 1e5 量级坐标上失效、在 1e-3 量级坐标上过度合并 |
| 6 | `part_bbox_overlap` 的粒度 | §5.5 逐 piece | **逐 body**；body 内成员允许重叠 | 强行拆散螺栓圈会把它抹成一条直线，对称性彻底丢失。见 §11.3 S8 |
| 7 | `layout.axis_angle` 默认值 | §4.2 示例 `152` | **改为 `124`** | §11.1 裁决 D4，闭式 `θ*`。152° 下 `sheet_fill` 只有 0.380 |

**对 `qa.py`（§5.5）的修订要求**（另一个实现 agent 的输入）：

1. `geometry_occupancy` 的口径钉死为 `area(GEOM∪HIDDEN 包围盒) / area(全部模型空间实体包围盒)`
   （裁决 D1，与失败基线的 0.1353 逐位吻合）。qa 实现者若采用别的口径，**必须报出不一致**，不许沉默。
2. **新增** `sheet_fill_min = 0.55`：`area(GEOM∪HIDDEN 包围盒) / (aw × ah)`（裁决 D2），
   其中 `h` 取自 `NUM` 图层 TEXT 实体的字高，`aw = 180 - 2*label_margin_mm(h)`、
   `ah = 250 - label_margin_mm(h) - caption_band_mm(h)`，两个函数与 §11.6 同定义。
   **分母不要取整张 FRAME**：正方形几何在任何字号档下都只能得到 0.487~0.513，会结构性地
   过不了闸门，而它的长宽比旋转不变，hint 里的「改 axis_angle」什么也改变不了。
   这是唯一一条真正度量「有没有填满纸」的闸门；`geometry_occupancy` 尺度不变，度量不了它。
3. **新增** `text_height_mm_min = 3.5`：直接读 `NUM` 图层 TEXT 实体的字高（裁决 D3）。
   没有这一条，`text_slot_ratio` 是自指的（`h ≡ 0.45·slot`），永远不会因为字太小而报警。
4. `text_slot_ratio` 的 slot 观测口径改为：沿每条 `LEADER` 的第一个点（锚点）找出它所在的
   **几何连通簇**，取该簇外廓的 `max(w, h)` 作为该标记的 slot，再取全体最小。
   这才是「标记相对它所指的零件是否可读」的正确度量，且完全可从 DXF 算出。
5. `part_bbox_overlap` 读 renderer 写出的 sidecar `out/<figure id>.layout.json`
   （内容 = `diagnostics["body_boxes"]` 缩放平移到毫米后的副本）；sidecar 缺失时退回几何连通簇聚类，
   并在 `detail` 里注明用的是退化口径。**不要试图从 DXF 曲线猜零件边界。**
6. **新增** `leader_hits_numeral_box_max = 0`：任一 `LEADER` 折线段不得与任一 `NUM` 文字的
   外接框相交（§5.3 明文把已提交的数字框列为 obstacles，§11.7 的 `_dyn_ok` 已构造性保证）。

**对 `plan.py`（§5.6）的修订要求**：`apply_defaults` 里 `axis_angle` 的默认值改为
`AXIS_ANGLE_DEFAULT = 124`（裁决 D4）；夹紧区间 `[120,180]` 与 `W_CLAMPED` 不变。

**待核对项（写进 `open_issues`，不阻塞实现）**：`TEXT_FLOOR_MM = 3.5` 的规范依据为
GB/T 14691 字号系列 + CNIPA 对附图缩小后清晰度的要求，落地前需按 `iteration-plan-v2.md` §7.5
的保留核对现行《专利审查指南》原文。若该下限被证伪为 2.5 mm，§11.1 的件数上限由 29 升到约 41，
裁决方向不变（一维串更加够用）。

## 12. Cross-model contract audit (2026-09-03)

Before implementation started, this contract was audited by five models from five vendors, each
given the identical adversarial brief: *falsify the claim that any competent LLM reading this
document produces the same behaviour.* Reports are outside the repo (they quote nothing
confidential, but they are working notes, not deliverables).

| Runtime | Model | Report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CodeBuddy | GLM-5.1 (智谱) | 25 KB |
| CodeBuddy | Kimi-K2.5 (月之暗面) | 22 KB |
| CodeBuddy | DeepSeek-V3.2 | 26 KB |
| CodeBuddy | MiniMax-M2.7 | 27 KB |
| Codex CLI | GPT-5.x | (see run log) |

**Acceptance rule: a finding counted only if ≥2 models raised it independently, or if one model
raised it and it was reproduced against the actual library.** Every library claim below was
re-verified locally rather than taken on trust — one of them turned out to be wrong.

| Finding | Models | Verified | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| §11 empty — the two hardest algorithms unspecified | 4/4 | known | pending the design review |
| `load_assembly` sort-key rounding precision unspecified | 4/4 | yes | fixed at `round(v, 6)`, §5.1 |
| `normalized_digest` sort key and rounding under-specified | 4/4 | yes | full recipe written out, §5.4 |
| zero-overlap postconditions unsatisfiable on dense input | 4/4 | mathematically | escape hatch made explicit, §5.2/5.3 |
| `fit_to_frame` target occupancy undefined | 3/4 | yes | `TARGET_OCCUPANCY = 0.62` + formula, §5.2 |
| `np.argsort` default is not stable | 3/4 | `quicksort` | §7 rule 5 strengthened |
| `roll_for_axis` algorithm unspecified, legacy compares raw floats | 3/4 | yes | closed form specified, §5.1 |
| `DENSITY` values have no stated semantics | 3/4 | yes | defined against median part extent, §5.2 |
| OCCT traversal order not guaranteed | 3/4 | plausible | already covered by the §5.1 sort; rationale added |
| `$ACADVER` is not a volatile header var | 2/4 | `'AC1032'` | removed from `VOLATILE_HEADER_VARS` |
| `fnmatch` is case-sensitive per platform | 2/4 | yes | `fnmatchcase` mandated, §7 rule 6 |
| `split_suggestions` "always emitted" contradicts its own cap | 1/4 | logical | rewritten, §4.1 |
| `label: "once"` — which instance gets the numeral | 1/4 | yes | first by sorted key, §4.2 |
| `$INSUNITS` defaults to 6 (metres), not absent | 1/4 | `6` | `write_figure` must set 4, §5.4 |
| `list[int]` works at runtime on Python 3.9 | 1/4 | yes | §1 relaxed |
| **`jsonschema` is not installed** | 1/4 | **false — 4.25.1 is installed** | rejected |

The last row is the reason for the verify-locally rule. A single model's confident factual claim
about the environment was simply wrong; had it been actioned, the plan validator would have been
written around a dependency that was there all along.

Two failure modes of the harness itself are worth recording, because they cost a full round:
`codebuddy --disallowedTools` is variadic and swallowed the prompt that followed it, producing four
empty reports with exit code 0 — a silent success. Use the single-valued `--tools` instead. And the
